# RPi_Serial_Display
 
This simple Python script displays messages recieved on the Serial bus to the Shell window

This is the first time I've ever used a Raspberry Pi so the code will be *rough*. I'd love any help/suggestions anyone has to offer!

This script can be tested with the LCD mission for ARMA: https://github.com/FatLurch/TEST_ARMACOM_LCD.vr

 ## Wiring:
 **Important:** Be sure the serial adapter you use is configured for 3.3 volt signals, *not* 5 volts (your board could be damaged otherwise)
 
 I used an FTDI adapter (FT232) like this one on Amazon (Affiliate Link): https://amzn.to/2Y5IEdi
